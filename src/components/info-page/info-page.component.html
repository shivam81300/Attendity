              <p>Your attendance data is stored locally on your device using your browser's local storage. It is not sent to any external server, ensuring your data remains private and accessible even offline.</p>

              <h3 class="font-semibold">Can I use this app on multiple devices?</h3>
              <p>Since data is stored locally, it does not sync between devices automatically. Each device will have its own separate data.</p>

              <h3 class="font-semibold">What is the "75% Rule"?</h3>
              <p>Most educational institutions require a minimum of 75% attendance to be eligible for examinations. The app's calculator helps you track this, showing how many classes you can miss or need to attend to stay above this threshold. You can learn more by tapping the settings icon and selecting "75% Rule Explained".</p>

          <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> July 24, 2024</p>
          <p>Your privacy is critically important to us. Attendify is designed to be a private, personal tool.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Storage:</strong> All data you enter into Attendify, including subject names, attendance records, and notes, is stored exclusively in your browser's local storage on your device.</li>

            <li><strong>Third-Party Services:</strong> The app utilizes the Gemini API for its AI features. When you interact with the AI assistant or import timetables, the relevant data (like your prompts or uploaded images) is sent to Google's servers for processing. This is necessary to provide the AI functionality. We encourage you to review Google's privacy policy. No other personal attendance data is sent.</li>
